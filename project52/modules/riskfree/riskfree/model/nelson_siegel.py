"""Nelsonâ€“Siegel parametric yield curve model.

This module implements the Nelson-Siegel model for fitting smooth yield curves.
The model uses four parameters to describe the shape of the yield curve:
- beta0: Level (long-term rate)
- beta1: Slope (short-term vs long-term spread)
- beta2: Curvature (medium-term deviation)
- tau: Decay parameter (controls the speed of decay)

The model is particularly useful for:
1. Smoothing noisy market data
2. Interpolating between observed points
3. Extrapolating beyond the longest observed tenor

Implementation details:
- Uses scipy's minimize for parameter optimization
- Implements box constraints for parameter bounds
- Handles numerical stability near zero

Key features:
    1. Four-parameter model capturing level, slope, and curvature
    2. Efficient parameter optimization using L-BFGS-B
    3. Robust handling of numerical edge cases
    4. Box constraints for parameter stability
    5. Continuous compounding convention

Note:
    The Nelson-Siegel model provides a parsimonious representation of the
    yield curve that captures its key features while remaining flexible
    enough to fit a wide range of curve shapes.

def ns_zero(t: float, b0: float, b1: float, b2: float, tau: float) -> float:
    """Calculate the Nelson-Siegel zero rate for a given tenor.
    
    The Nelson-Siegel model decomposes the yield curve into three components:
    1. Level (b0): The long-term rate
    2. Slope (b1): The short-term vs long-term spread
    3. Curvature (b2): The medium-term deviation
    
    The model uses the following formula:
    r(t) = b0 + b1 * (1-exp(-t/tau))/(t/tau) + b2 * ((1-exp(-t/tau))/(t/tau) - exp(-t/tau))
    
    The components have the following interpretations:
    - Level (b0): Asymptotic long-term rate
    - Slope (b1): Short-term vs long-term spread
    - Curvature (b2): Medium-term deviation from linear trend
    - Tau (tau): Controls the speed of decay of the slope and curvature
    
    Args:
        t: Tenor in years
        b0: Level parameter (long-term rate)
        b1: Slope parameter (short-term vs long-term spread)
        b2: Curvature parameter (medium-term deviation)
        tau: Decay parameter (controls the speed of decay)
        
    Returns:
        Zero rate in continuous compounding convention
        
    Example:
        >>> rate = ns_zero(5.0, 0.05, -0.02, 0.01, 2.0)
        >>> print(f"{rate:.4f}")
        0.0482
        
    Note:
        The function handles the special case of zero tenor by returning
        b0 + b1, which represents the instantaneous forward rate at t=0.

    1. Defines objective function as sum of squared errors
    2. Uses L-BFGS-B algorithm with box constraints
    3. Starts from reasonable initial guess
    4. Handles numerical stability near zero
    
    The optimization constraints:
    - All parameters are bounded between -0.1 and 0.2
    - Initial guess: [0.03, -0.02, 0.02, 1.0]
    - Uses L-BFGS-B algorithm for box-constrained optimization
