"""Day-count convention utilities for financial calculations.

This module provides functions for calculating year fractions between dates
using standard financial day-count conventions. These conventions are used
in fixed income calculations to determine accrual periods and interest payments.

Supported conventions:
- ACT/365: Actual days divided by 365 (also known as ACT/365 Fixed)
- ACT/360: Actual days divided by 360 (common for money market instruments)

Note:
    The module currently supports only the most common conventions.
    Additional conventions (30/360, ACT/ACT, etc.) can be added as needed.
