"""Day-count convention utilities for financial calculations.

This module provides functions for calculating year fractions between dates
using standard financial day-count conventions. These conventions are used
in fixed income calculations to determine accrual periods and interest payments.

Supported conventions:
- ACT/365: Actual days divided by 365 (also known as ACT/365 Fixed)
- ACT/360: Actual days divided by 360 (common for money market instruments)

Key features:
    1. Precise calculations to the second
    2. Support for common day-count conventions
    3. Proper handling of leap years
    4. Clear error messages for unsupported conventions
    5. Extensible design for adding new conventions

Note:
    The module currently supports only the most common conventions.
    Additional conventions (30/360, ACT/ACT, etc.) can be added as needed.
    The calculations are exact to the second, which is important for
    precise financial calculations.

    """Calculate the year fraction between two dates using the specified convention.
    
    This function calculates the fraction of a year between two dates using
    standard financial day-count conventions. The calculation is exact to the
    second for ACT/365 and ACT/360 conventions.
    
    The function handles:
    - Precise calculations to the second
    - Support for common day-count conventions
    - Proper handling of leap years
    - Clear error messages for unsupported conventions
    
    Args:
        start: Start date and time
        end: End date and time
        convention: Day-count convention to use. Currently supported:
                   - "ACT/365": Actual days divided by 365
                   - "ACT/360": Actual days divided by 360
                   
    Returns:
        float: Year fraction between start and end dates
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If an unsupported convention is specified
        
    Example:
        >>> from datetime import datetime
        >>> start = datetime(2024, 1, 1)
        >>> end = datetime(2024, 7, 1)
        >>> yearfrac(start, end, "ACT/365")  # Half year
        0.5
        >>> yearfrac(start, end, "ACT/360")  # Slightly more than half
        0.5069444444444444
        
    Note:
        The calculations are exact to the second, which is important for
        precise financial calculations. The function uses the total number
        of seconds between dates to ensure accuracy, especially for
        intraday calculations.
