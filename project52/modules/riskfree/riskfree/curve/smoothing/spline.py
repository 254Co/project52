"""Cubic spline yield curve smoothing implementation.

This module implements a cubic spline interpolation approach to yield curve
smoothing. Cubic splines provide a smooth curve that passes exactly through
the observed points while maintaining continuous first and second derivatives.

The cubic spline model:
    - Uses piecewise cubic polynomials between each pair of knots
    - Ensures CÂ² continuity (continuous up to second derivatives)
    - Can use different boundary conditions (natural, clamped, etc.)

Advantages:
    1. Exact fit to observed points
    2. Smooth first and second derivatives
    3. No oscillatory behavior at the ends
    4. Good for interpolation between known points

Note:
    While cubic splines provide excellent interpolation, they may not be
    suitable for extrapolation beyond the range of observed tenors.
