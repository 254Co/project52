"""
Bermudan option payoff functions for the LSM Engine.

This module is intended to contain payoff functions specific to Bermudan options,
which are options that can be exercised at predetermined dates before maturity.
Unlike American options that can be exercised at any time, Bermudan options
have a discrete set of exercise dates.

Note: This is currently a placeholder module. Implement specific Bermudan
payoff functions here as needed.
