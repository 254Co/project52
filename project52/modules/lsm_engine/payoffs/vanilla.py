Vanilla Option Payoff Generators

This module provides payoff functions for plain-vanilla American and European options.
The payoff functions are designed to work with the Longstaff-Schwartz Method (LSM)
engine for option pricing.

Available payoff functions:
- American put: max(K - S, 0) at each exercise date
- American call: max(S - K, 0) at each exercise date
- European put: max(K - S, 0) at maturity only
- European call: max(S - K, 0) at maturity only

Each function returns a callable that takes a price path array and returns
the corresponding payoff matrix.
