Adjoint-SDE Control Variate Variance Reduction Module

This module provides a stub for implementing control variate variance reduction
using adjoint SDE techniques in Monte Carlo simulations. Control variates are
used to reduce the variance of Monte Carlo estimators by leveraging known
expectations of correlated variables.

Key features:
- Placeholder for adjoint-based control variate implementation
- Designed for integration with pathwise and adjoint Monte Carlo engines
- Supports plug-in of precomputed control variate terms

Typical use case:
- Variance reduction in Monte Carlo pricing of derivatives
- Integration with adjoint or pathwise sensitivity engines

    """
    Combine pathwise payoff with a precomputed control variate for variance reduction.
    
    This function applies the control variate technique to reduce the variance of
    Monte Carlo estimators. It assumes the existence of a control variate with a
    known expected value and computes the optimal adjustment to the payoff.
    
    Args:
        paths (np.ndarray): Simulated Monte Carlo paths, shape (n_paths, n_steps+1, n_factors)
        payoff (Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray]): Payoff function mapping paths to payoffs
        cv_term (float): Known expected value of the control variate (E[control_variate])
    
    Returns:
        float: Variance-reduced Monte Carlo estimator
    
    Notes:
        - This is a stub; in production, cv_vals should be computed from paths
        - The function currently uses zeros as a placeholder for cv_vals
        - The optimal beta is computed to minimize variance
        - The adjustment is: payoff - beta * (cv_vals - cv_term)
    
    Example:
        >>> # In production, cv_vals would be computed from paths
        >>> price = adjoint_control_variate(paths, payoff, cv_term=1.0)
    """
    payoffs = payoff(paths)
    # Assume cv_term = E[control_variate] known
    # and we have control variate value stored: cv_vals
    # Here cv_vals placeholder as zeros
    cv_vals = np.zeros_like(payoffs)
    beta = np.cov(payoffs, cv_vals)[0,1] / (np.var(cv_vals) + 1e-12)
    adjusted = payoffs - beta * (cv_vals - cv_term)
