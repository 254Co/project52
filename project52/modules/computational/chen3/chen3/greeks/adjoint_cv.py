Adjoint-SDE Control Variate Variance Reduction Module

This module provides a stub for implementing control variate variance reduction
using adjoint SDE techniques in Monte Carlo simulations. Control variates are
used to reduce the variance of Monte Carlo estimators by leveraging known
expectations of correlated variables.

Key features:
- Placeholder for adjoint-based control variate implementation
- Designed for integration with pathwise and adjoint Monte Carlo engines
- Supports plug-in of precomputed control variate terms
- Efficient implementation using numpy vectorization
- Automatic computation of optimal control variate weights

Implementation details:
- Uses adjoint SDE techniques for control variate construction
- Computes optimal weights to minimize variance
- Supports arbitrary payoff functions
- Handles multi-dimensional state processes
- Maintains numerical stability through careful weight computation

Typical use cases:
- Variance reduction in Monte Carlo pricing of derivatives
- Integration with adjoint or pathwise sensitivity engines
- Risk management and hedging calculations
- Model validation and benchmarking
- Real-time risk reporting

Mathematical formulation:
    For a control variate Y with known expectation E[Y], the variance-reduced
    estimator is:
    X_adj = X - β(Y - E[Y])
    where:
    - X is the original estimator
    - Y is the control variate
    - β is the optimal weight minimizing Var[X_adj]
    - β = Cov[X,Y] / Var[Y]

Example usage:
    >>> # Define a European call payoff
    >>> def european_call_payoff(paths):
    ...     S = paths[:, -1, 0]  # final asset prices
    ...     K = 100.0  # strike price
    ...     return np.maximum(S - K, 0)
    ...
    >>> # Compute control variate term (example)
    >>> def compute_control_variate(paths):
    ...     # Implementation depends on the specific control variate
    ...     return np.zeros(len(paths))
    ...
    >>> # Simulate paths
    >>> paths = simulate_paths(n_paths=10000, n_steps=252)
    >>> # Compute variance-reduced price
    >>> price = adjoint_control_variate(
    ...     paths, 
    ...     european_call_payoff,
    ...     cv_term=1.0  # known expectation of control variate
    ... )

Notes:
    - The control variate should be highly correlated with the payoff
    - The optimal weight β is computed to minimize variance
    - Consider using multiple control variates for better reduction
    - The method requires known expectations of control variates
    - Implementation requires careful handling of numerical stability

    Combine pathwise payoff with a precomputed control variate for variance reduction.
    
    This function applies the control variate technique to reduce the variance of
    Monte Carlo estimators. It assumes the existence of a control variate with a
    known expected value and computes the optimal adjustment to the payoff.
    
    The method works by:
    1. Computing the original payoff values
    2. Evaluating the control variate (if not provided)
    3. Computing the optimal weight β to minimize variance
    4. Adjusting the payoff using the control variate
    5. Taking the mean of the adjusted values
    
    Mathematical formulation:
        X_adj = X - β(Y - E[Y])
        where:
        - X is the original payoff
        - Y is the control variate
        - E[Y] is the known expectation (cv_term)
        - β = Cov[X,Y] / Var[Y] is the optimal weight
    
    Args:
        paths (np.ndarray): 
            Simulated Monte Carlo paths with shape (n_paths, n_steps+1, n_factors)
            - First dimension: number of simulation paths
            - Second dimension: time steps (including initial value)
            - Third dimension: state factors
        payoff (Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray]): 
            Payoff function that maps paths to payoffs
            - Input: path array of shape (n_paths, n_steps+1, n_factors)
            - Output: array of shape (n_paths,) containing payoffs
        cv_term (float): 
            Known expected value of the control variate (E[Y])
            - Should be precomputed analytically or numerically
            - Must be accurate for effective variance reduction
        cv_vals (np.ndarray, optional): 
            Precomputed control variate values with shape (n_paths,)
            - If None, zeros are used as a placeholder
            - In production, should be computed from paths
    
    Returns:
        float: Variance-reduced Monte Carlo estimator
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If paths array is empty or has incorrect shape
        TypeError: If payoff function is not callable

        >>> # Define payoff and control variate
        >>> def european_call_payoff(paths):
        ...     S = paths[:, -1, 0]  # final asset prices
        ...     K = 100.0  # strike price
        ...     return np.maximum(S - K, 0)
        ...
        >>> def compute_control_variate(paths):
        ...     # Example: use geometric average as control variate
        ...     S = paths[:, :, 0]  # asset price paths
        ...     return np.exp(np.mean(np.log(S), axis=1))
        ...
        >>> # Simulate paths
        >>> paths = simulate_paths(n_paths=10000, n_steps=252)
