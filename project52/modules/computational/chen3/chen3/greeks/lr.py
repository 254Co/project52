Likelihood-Ratio (Score-Function) Greeks Module

This module provides a stub for the likelihood-ratio (score-function) method for
computing Greeks, such as vega, in Monte Carlo simulations. The likelihood-ratio
method estimates sensitivities by reweighting payoffs according to the derivative
of the log-likelihood of the simulated paths with respect to model parameters.

Key features:
- Placeholder for likelihood-ratio vega estimator
- Designed for integration with pathwise Monte Carlo engines
- Requires access to Brownian increments (dW) for correct implementation

Typical use case:
- Estimating vega (∂V/∂σ) in models where pathwise differentiation is not feasible
- Variance reduction for Greeks in Monte Carlo pricing

    Estimate vega (∂V/∂σ) using the likelihood-ratio (score-function) method.
    
    This function is a stub and requires access to the Brownian increments (dW)
    used in the simulation of the S-factor. In production, these increments should
    be recorded and passed to this function to compute the correct weights.
    
    The likelihood-ratio method estimates the sensitivity of the option value to
    volatility by reweighting the payoff with the derivative of the log-likelihood
    of the simulated paths with respect to σ.
    
    Args:
        paths (np.ndarray): Simulated Monte Carlo paths, shape (n_paths, n_steps+1, n_factors)
        payoff (Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray]): Payoff function mapping paths to payoffs
    
    Returns:
        float: Estimated vega (∂V/∂σ) using the likelihood-ratio method
    
    Raises:
        NotImplementedError: Always, as this is a stub for future implementation
    
    Example:
        >>> # In production, pass the S-factor dW array to compute LR weights
        >>> vega = vega_likelihood_ratio(paths, payoff)
