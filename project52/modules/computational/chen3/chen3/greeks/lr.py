Likelihood-Ratio (Score-Function) Greeks Module

This module provides a stub for the likelihood-ratio (score-function) method for
computing Greeks, such as vega, in Monte Carlo simulations. The likelihood-ratio
method estimates sensitivities by reweighting payoffs according to the derivative
of the log-likelihood of the simulated paths with respect to model parameters.

Key features:
- Placeholder for likelihood-ratio vega estimator
- Designed for integration with pathwise Monte Carlo engines
- Requires access to Brownian increments (dW) for correct implementation
- Supports multi-dimensional state processes
- Efficient implementation using numpy vectorization

Implementation details:
- Uses score function (derivative of log-likelihood) for sensitivity estimation
- Requires storing Brownian increments during path simulation
- Supports arbitrary payoff functions
- Handles multi-dimensional state processes
- Maintains numerical stability through careful weight computation

Typical use cases:
- Estimating vega (∂V/∂σ) in models where pathwise differentiation is not feasible
- Variance reduction for Greeks in Monte Carlo pricing
- Risk management and hedging calculations
- Model validation and benchmarking
- Real-time risk reporting

Mathematical formulation:
    For a stochastic process dS = μ(S)dt + σ(S)dW, the likelihood-ratio vega is:
    ∂V/∂σ = E[V(S) * ∂log(L)/∂σ]
    where:
    - V(S) is the option payoff
    - L is the likelihood function
    - ∂log(L)/∂σ is the score function

Example usage:
    >>> # Define a European call payoff
    >>> def european_call_payoff(paths):
    ...     S = paths[:, -1, 0]  # final asset prices
    ...     K = 100.0  # strike price
    ...     return np.maximum(S - K, 0)
    ...
    >>> # Simulate paths and store Brownian increments
    >>> paths, dw_s = simulate_paths_with_dw(n_paths=10000, n_steps=252)
    >>> # Compute vega
    >>> vega = vega_likelihood_ratio(paths, european_call_payoff, dw_s)

Notes:
    - The method requires storing Brownian increments during simulation
    - The score function must be computed correctly for the specific model
    - Consider using variance reduction techniques for better accuracy
    - The method works well for discontinuous payoffs
    - Implementation requires careful handling of numerical stability

    Estimate vega (∂V/∂σ) using the likelihood-ratio (score-function) method.
    
    This function estimates the sensitivity of the option value to volatility by
    reweighting the payoff with the derivative of the log-likelihood of the
    simulated paths with respect to σ. It requires access to the Brownian
    increments (dW) used in the simulation of the S-factor.
    
    The method works by:
    1. Computing the score function (derivative of log-likelihood)
    2. Evaluating the payoff for each path
    3. Multiplying the payoff by the score function
    4. Taking the expectation (mean) of the weighted payoffs
    
    Mathematical formulation:
        ∂V/∂σ = E[V(S) * ∂log(L)/∂σ]
        where:
        - V(S) is the option payoff
        - L is the likelihood function
        - ∂log(L)/∂σ is the score function
    
    Args:
        paths (np.ndarray): 
            Simulated Monte Carlo paths with shape (n_paths, n_steps+1, n_factors)
            - First dimension: number of simulation paths
            - Second dimension: time steps (including initial value)
            - Third dimension: state factors (first is asset price)
        payoff (Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray]): 
            Payoff function that maps paths to payoffs
            - Input: path array of shape (n_paths, n_steps+1, n_factors)
            - Output: array of shape (n_paths,) containing payoffs
        dw_s (np.ndarray, optional): 
            Brownian increments for the S-factor with shape (n_paths, n_steps)
            - Required for computing the score function
            - If None, raises NotImplementedError
    
    Returns:
        float: Estimated vega (∂V/∂σ) using the likelihood-ratio method
    
    Raises:
        NotImplementedError: If dw_s is not provided
        ValueError: If paths array is empty or has incorrect shape
        TypeError: If payoff function is not callable

        ...     # Simulate paths and store dW

        ...     # ... simulation logic ...
        ...     return paths, dw_s

        ...     K = 100.0  # strike price
        ...     return np.maximum(S - K, 0)
