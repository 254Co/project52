Adjoint Algorithmic Differentiation (AAD) Greeks Module

This module provides a stub for adjoint-mode algorithmic differentiation (AAD)
for computing sensitivities (Greeks) in Monte Carlo simulations. AAD enables
efficient computation of derivatives with respect to model inputs, such as the
initial asset price, by propagating gradients backward through the simulation.

Key features:
- Placeholder for reverse-mode AAD implementation
- Designed for integration with custom or third-party AD/tape libraries
- Intended for high-performance, production-grade risk engines
- Support for multi-dimensional state processes
- Efficient computation of multiple Greeks simultaneously

Implementation details:
- Uses reverse-mode automatic differentiation
- Requires recording of computation graph (tape)
- Supports arbitrary payoff functions
- Handles multi-dimensional state processes
- Maintains numerical stability through careful gradient propagation

Typical use cases:
- Efficient computation of pathwise Greeks (e.g., delta, vega) in large-scale MC
- Integration with C++/CUDA or Python-based AD frameworks
- Risk management and hedging calculations
- Model validation and benchmarking
- Real-time risk reporting

Mathematical formulation:
    For a stochastic process dS = μ(S)dt + σ(S)dW, AAD computes:
    ∂V/∂θ = ∂V/∂S * ∂S/∂θ
    where:
    - V is the option value
    - S is the state process
    - θ is the parameter of interest
    - ∂V/∂S is computed by backward propagation
    - ∂S/∂θ is computed by forward propagation

Example usage:
    >>> # Define a European call payoff
    >>> def european_call_payoff(paths):
    ...     S = paths[:, -1, 0]  # final asset prices
    ...     K = 100.0  # strike price
    ...     return np.maximum(S - K, 0)
    ...
    >>> # Simulate paths with AAD tape
    >>> paths, tape = simulate_paths_with_tape(n_paths=10000, n_steps=252)
    >>> # Compute delta using AAD
    >>> delta = greeks_aad(paths, european_call_payoff, tape)

Notes:
    - AAD requires recording the computation graph (tape)
    - The method is most efficient for computing multiple Greeks
    - Consider using GPU acceleration for large-scale simulations
    - The implementation requires careful handling of numerical stability
    - Integration with C++/CUDA can provide significant performance gains

    Compute the derivative of the option value with respect to the initial asset price (∂V/∂S₀)
    using adjoint (reverse-mode) algorithmic differentiation (AAD).
    
    This function computes sensitivities by propagating gradients backward through
    the computation graph recorded during path simulation. It requires a taped
    version of the simulation engine to enable reverse-mode differentiation.
    
    The method works by:
    1. Recording the computation graph during path simulation
    2. Computing the payoff and its derivative with respect to final state
    3. Propagating gradients backward through the computation graph
    4. Accumulating gradients with respect to initial conditions
    
    Mathematical formulation:
        ∂V/∂S₀ = ∂V/∂S_T * ∂S_T/∂S_{T-1} * ... * ∂S_1/∂S₀
        where:
        - V is the option value
        - S_t is the state at time t
        - ∂V/∂S_T is the payoff derivative
        - ∂S_t/∂S_{t-1} is the state transition derivative
    
    Args:
        paths (np.ndarray): 
            Simulated Monte Carlo paths with shape (n_paths, n_steps+1, n_factors)
            - First dimension: number of simulation paths
            - Second dimension: time steps (including initial value)
            - Third dimension: state factors (first is asset price)
        payoff (Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray]): 
            Payoff function that maps paths to payoffs
            - Input: path array of shape (n_paths, n_steps+1, n_factors)
            - Output: array of shape (n_paths,) containing payoffs
        tape (Any, optional): 
            Computation graph (tape) recorded during path simulation
            - Required for reverse-mode differentiation
            - If None, raises NotImplementedError
    
    Returns:
        float: Sensitivity (Greek) value, e.g., delta (∂V/∂S₀)
    
    Raises:
        NotImplementedError: If tape is not provided
        ValueError: If paths array is empty or has incorrect shape
        TypeError: If payoff function is not callable
    
    Example:
        >>> # Define payoff and simulation with tape
        >>> def european_call_payoff(paths):
        ...     S = paths[:, -1, 0]  # final asset prices
        ...     K = 100.0  # strike price
        ...     return np.maximum(S - K, 0)
        ...
        >>> def simulate_paths_with_tape(n_paths, n_steps):
        ...     # Simulate paths and record computation graph
        ...     paths = np.zeros((n_paths, n_steps+1, 1))
        ...     tape = record_computation_graph()
        ...     # ... simulation logic ...
        ...     return paths, tape
        ...
        >>> # Simulate and compute delta
        >>> paths, tape = simulate_paths_with_tape(n_paths=10000, n_steps=252)
