Adjoint Algorithmic Differentiation (AAD) Greeks Module

This module provides a stub for adjoint-mode algorithmic differentiation (AAD)
for computing sensitivities (Greeks) in Monte Carlo simulations. AAD enables
efficient computation of derivatives with respect to model inputs, such as the
initial asset price, by propagating gradients backward through the simulation.

Key features:
- Placeholder for reverse-mode AAD implementation
- Designed for integration with custom or third-party AD/tape libraries
- Intended for high-performance, production-grade risk engines

Typical use case:
- Efficient computation of pathwise Greeks (e.g., delta, vega) in large-scale MC
- Integration with C++/CUDA or Python-based AD frameworks

    Compute the derivative of the option value with respect to the initial asset price (∂V/∂S₀)
    using adjoint (reverse-mode) algorithmic differentiation (AAD).
    
    This function is a stub and requires a taped version of the simulation engine
    to enable reverse-mode differentiation. In production, this would be implemented
    using a custom tape or a third-party AD library (e.g., pyadjoint, C++/CUDA kernel).
    
    Args:
        paths (np.ndarray): Simulated Monte Carlo paths, shape (n_paths, n_steps+1, n_factors)
        payoff (Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray]): Payoff function mapping paths to payoffs
    
    Returns:
        float: Sensitivity (Greek) value, e.g., delta (∂V/∂S₀)
    
    Raises:
        NotImplementedError: Always, as this is a stub for future AAD integration
    
    Example:
        >>> # In production, this would use a taped simulation kernel
        >>> delta = greeks_aad(paths, payoff)
    """
    # In production, hook into a C++/CUDA kernel or Python tape.
