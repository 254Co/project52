Andersen-Piterbarg Order-1.5 Weak Scheme Implementation

This module implements the Andersen-Piterbarg scheme, a first-order weak scheme
specifically designed for CIR-like stochastic differential equations (SDEs).
The scheme includes a Milstein correction term to improve accuracy while
maintaining the weak convergence properties.

Key Features:
    - First-order weak convergence
    - Non-negativity preservation
    - Milstein correction for improved accuracy
    - Specifically designed for CIR processes
    - Efficient implementation with minimal computational overhead
    - Support for time-dependent coefficients
    - Support for both scalar and vector operations
    - Automatic handling of process parameters
    - Robust error handling and validation

Mathematical Formulation:
    The scheme approximates the solution of the SDE:
        dX_t = μ(X_t)dt + σ√X_t dW_t

    The discrete-time approximation is given by:
        X_{n+1} = X_n + μ(X_n)Δt + σ√X_n ΔW_n + (1/4)σ²(ΔW_n² - Δt)

    where:
        - X_n is the state at time step n
        - μ(X) is the drift function
        - σ is the diffusion coefficient
        - ΔW_n is a standard normal random variable
        - Δt is the time step size
        - The last term is the Milstein correction

Mathematical Properties:
    - Weak Order: 1.0
    - Strong Order: 0.5
    - Preserves non-negativity
    - Stable for CIR processes
    - Efficient for square-root diffusions
    - Consistency: First-order consistent
    - Error bound: O(Δt) in the weak sense, O(√Δt) in the strong sense

Implementation Details:
    - Supports both scalar and multi-dimensional SDEs
    - Includes Milstein correction for improved accuracy
    - Provides non-negativity preservation
    - Handles time-dependent coefficients
    - Efficient memory usage
    - Support for process-specific parameters
    - Automatic parameter validation
    - Robust error handling

    """
    Create an Andersen-Piterbarg step function for CIR-like SDEs.

    This function returns a step function that implements the Andersen-Piterbarg
    scheme with Milstein correction for numerical integration of CIR-like
    stochastic differential equations. The scheme is designed to preserve
    non-negativity of the solution while maintaining good weak convergence
    properties.

    Parameters
    ----------
    process : object
        A stochastic process object with drift() and diffusion() methods.
        The process should have a 'sigma' attribute for the Milstein correction.
        The drift() method should return the drift term μ(X).
        The diffusion() method should return the diffusion term σ√X.
        The process object should also have:
        - A 'sigma' attribute for the diffusion coefficient
        - Methods that accept both scalar and vector inputs
        - Proper error handling for invalid states
    dt : float
        Time step size for the numerical scheme (dt > 0)
        The step size should be chosen based on:
        - The process parameters (kappa, theta, sigma)
        - The desired accuracy
        - The stability requirements
        - The computational resources available

    Returns
    -------
    callable
        A step function that takes (state, z) as arguments and returns
        the next state according to the Andersen-Piterbarg scheme.
        The step function has the following signature:
            step(state: np.ndarray, z: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray
        The function handles:
        - Both scalar and vector inputs
        - Non-negativity preservation
        - Milstein correction
        - Error checking and validation

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from chen3.processes.interest_rate import ShortRateCIR
    >>> process = ShortRateCIR(kappa=0.1, theta=0.05, sigma=0.1, r0=0.03)
    >>> step = adf_scheme(process, dt=0.01)
    >>> next_state = step(current_state, random_normal)

    Notes
    -----
    - The scheme is first-order accurate in the weak sense
    - The scheme preserves non-negativity of the solution
    - The Milstein correction term improves accuracy for CIR processes
    - The scheme is particularly effective for square-root diffusions
    - The step size dt should be chosen based on the process parameters
    - The scheme is stable for typical CIR process parameters
    - The process object should implement proper error handling
    - The scheme automatically handles both scalar and vector operations
    - The Milstein correction is only applied if sigma is available
    - The scheme includes validation of input parameters

    def step(state, z):
        """
        Compute one step of the Andersen-Piterbarg scheme.

        The scheme includes:
        1. Euler-Maruyama term
        2. Milstein correction term (if sigma is available)
        3. Non-negativity preservation

        Parameters
        ----------
        state : np.ndarray
            Current state of the process
            Can be either scalar or vector
            Must be non-negative
        z : np.ndarray
            Standard normal random variables
            Should have the same shape as state
            Used for both drift and diffusion terms

        Returns
        -------
        np.ndarray
            Next state according to the Andersen-Piterbarg scheme
            Shape matches the input state
            Guaranteed to be non-negative

        Notes
        -----
        The step computation follows these steps:
        1. Compute drift term: μ(X_n)Δt
        2. Compute diffusion term: σ√X_n ΔW_n
        3. Add Milstein correction: (1/4)σ²(ΔW_n² - Δt)
        4. Ensure non-negativity: max(X_{n+1}, 0)

        - Automatic handling of scalar and vector inputs
        - Non-negativity preservation
        - Milstein correction for improved accuracy
