"""
Milstein scheme implementation for stochastic differential equations.

This module implements the Milstein scheme, a higher-order numerical method for solving
stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The Milstein scheme improves upon the Euler-Maruyama
method by including additional terms that account for the stochastic Taylor expansion.

Key Features:
    - First-order strong convergence (improved over Euler-Maruyama)
    - First-order weak convergence
    - Support for scalar and multi-dimensional SDEs
    - Adaptive time-stepping capability
    - Error estimation and control
    - Support for time-dependent coefficients
    - Efficient implementation with minimal overhead
    - Support for both scalar and vector operations
    - Improved accuracy for stiff SDEs
    - Better handling of multiplicative noise

Mathematical Formulation:
    The scheme approximates the solution of the SDE:
        dX_t = f(t,X_t)dt + g(t,X_t)dW_t

    using the discrete-time approximation:
        X_{t+Δt} = X_t + f(t,X_t)Δt + g(t,X_t)ΔW_t + 0.5 * g(t,X_t) * g'(t,X_t) * (ΔW_t² - Δt)

    where:
        - X_t is the state at time t
        - f(t,X_t) is the drift coefficient (can be time-dependent)
        - g(t,X_t) is the diffusion coefficient (can be time-dependent)
        - g'(t,X_t) is the derivative of g with respect to X
        - dW_t is the Wiener process increment
        - Δt is the time step size

Mathematical Properties:
    - Strong order of convergence: 1.0
    - Weak order of convergence: 1.0
    - Stability: Conditionally stable
    - Positivity: Not guaranteed to preserve positivity
    - Consistency: First-order consistent
    - Error bounds: O(Δt) for strong convergence
    - Error bounds: O(Δt) for weak convergence
    - Improved accuracy for multiplicative noise

Implementation Details:
    - Handles both scalar and multi-dimensional SDEs
    - Supports time-dependent coefficients
    - Provides error estimation when exact solution is available
    - Includes adaptive time-stepping capability
    - Efficient memory management for multi-path simulations
    - Handles cross-terms in multi-dimensional case
    - Supports both scalar and vector operations
