    Calculate the mean and confidence interval for a dataset.

    This function computes the sample mean and its confidence interval
    using the t-distribution. It is particularly useful for analyzing
    Monte Carlo simulation results.

    Args:
        data (np.ndarray): Input data array
        confidence (float): Confidence level between 0 and 1 (default: 0.95)

    Returns:
        Tuple[float, float, float]: A tuple containing:
            - mean: The sample mean
            - lower_bound: Lower bound of the confidence interval
            - upper_bound: Upper bound of the confidence interval

    Raises:
        NotImplementedError: This function is not yet implemented
        ValueError: If confidence is not between 0 and 1
        TypeError: If data is not a numpy array

    Note:
        The confidence interval is calculated using the t-distribution,
        which is appropriate for small sample sizes. For large samples,
        the normal distribution approximation could be used instead.
