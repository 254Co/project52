Apache Spark-based Distributed Path Simulator Implementation

This module implements a distributed path simulator for the three-factor Chen model
using Apache Spark. The implementation leverages Spark's distributed computing
capabilities to parallelize Monte Carlo path generation across a cluster of machines.

The Spark backend is particularly useful for:
1. Large-scale Monte Carlo simulations requiring distributed computation
2. Processing massive datasets across multiple machines
3. Fault-tolerant and scalable computation
4. Integration with existing Spark-based data pipelines

The implementation uses:
- PySpark for distributed computation
- Pandas UDFs for efficient path generation
- Arrow optimization for better performance
- Chunked processing for memory efficiency

    Apache Spark-based distributed path simulator for the three-factor Chen model.
    
    This class implements a distributed path generator that leverages Apache Spark
    to parallelize Monte Carlo path generation across a cluster. It uses PySpark's
    distributed computing capabilities and Pandas UDFs for efficient path generation.
    
    The simulator is designed to:
    1. Split the total number of paths into manageable chunks
    2. Distribute chunks across Spark workers
    3. Generate paths in parallel using Pandas UDFs
    4. Aggregate results from all workers
    
    Attributes:
        model: The three-factor Chen model instance
        params: Simulation parameters including:
            - n_paths: Total number of Monte Carlo paths
            - n_steps: Number of time steps
            - dt: Time step size
        spark: PySpark SparkSession instance
        L: Pre-computed Cholesky decomposition of correlation matrix
    
    Example:
        >>> from chen3.config import Settings
        >>> settings = Settings(backend="spark", n_paths=10000000, n_steps=252)
        >>> simulator = SparkSimulator(model, settings)
        >>> paths = simulator.generate()  # Distributed computation

        - Requires Apache Spark cluster to be set up and running

        - Includes automatic cleanup of Spark resources
