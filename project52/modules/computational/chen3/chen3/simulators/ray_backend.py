Ray-based Distributed Path Simulator Implementation

This module provides a framework for distributed path simulation using the Ray
framework. The implementation is designed to distribute Monte Carlo path
generation across a cluster of machines, enabling parallel processing of
large-scale simulations.

The Ray backend is particularly useful for:
1. Large-scale Monte Carlo simulations
2. Distributed computing across multiple machines
3. Dynamic resource allocation
4. Fault-tolerant computation

Note: This is a placeholder implementation that needs to be completed with
actual Ray-based distributed computation logic.

    Ray-based distributed path simulator for the three-factor Chen model.
    
    This class is designed to distribute Monte Carlo path generation across
    a Ray cluster. It provides a framework for parallel processing of
    large-scale simulations by distributing the workload across multiple
    machines in the cluster.
    
    The simulator is intended to:
    1. Split the total number of paths across available workers
    2. Distribute the computation across the Ray cluster
    3. Aggregate results from all workers
    4. Handle fault tolerance and recovery
    
    Attributes:
        model: The three-factor Chen model instance
        params: Simulation parameters including:
            - n_paths: Total number of Monte Carlo paths
            - n_steps: Number of time steps
            - dt: Time step size
    
    Example:
        >>> from chen3.config import Settings
        >>> settings = Settings(backend="ray", n_paths=10000000, n_steps=252)
        >>> simulator = RaySimulator(model, settings)
        >>> paths = simulator.generate()  # Distributed computation
    
    Notes:
        - Requires Ray cluster to be set up and running
        - Implementation is currently a placeholder
        - Will be completed with actual distributed computation logic
