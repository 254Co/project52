"""
Core Model Implementation for the Three-Factor Chen Model

This module implements the main ChenModel class that encapsulates the three-factor
stochastic model combining interest rates, equity prices, and rough volatility.
The model is particularly suited for pricing complex financial instruments where
traditional models may fall short in capturing market dynamics.

The three factors are:
1. Interest Rate: CIR process for stochastic rates
2. Equity Price: Geometric Brownian motion with stochastic volatility
3. Rough Volatility: Heston-type variance process with rough features

Features:
- Unified interface for model parameters and simulation
- Support for pricing and risk analysis of complex derivatives
- Extensible for additional pricing or simulation methods

Typical usage:
    from chen3 import ChenModel, ModelParams
    params = ModelParams(...)
    model = ChenModel(params)
    price = model.price_instrument(...)

    Implementation of the three-factor Chen model for financial derivatives pricing.
    
    This class serves as the main interface for the model, encapsulating all
    parameters and providing methods for simulation and pricing. The model
    combines stochastic interest rates, equity prices, and rough volatility
    to provide a comprehensive framework for pricing complex financial instruments.
    
    The model is particularly well-suited for:
    - Long-dated options where interest rate risk is significant
    - Products with complex volatility dynamics
    - Instruments requiring correlation between rates and equity
    - Path-dependent options where rough volatility is important
    
    Attributes:
        params (ModelParams): Complete set of model parameters including:
            - Interest rate parameters (CIR process)
            - Equity parameters (price and variance processes)
            - Correlation structure between factors
    
    Example:
        >>> from chen3 import ChenModel, ModelParams
        >>> params = ModelParams(...)  # Initialize with appropriate parameters
        >>> model = ChenModel(params)
        >>> price = model.price_instrument(...)  # Price a financial instrument
